# woo_tax_calcs
This is an effort to ease your tax filing if you are like me using SPOT, MARGIN, FUTURES on WOOX sub accounts and filing with Koinly.

Main problem is that Koinly Does not import Futures transactions and WOOX is as of now not providing CSV files with Futures PNL transactions. There is another file to Help you calculate the margin borrow and repay transactions which as of now needs some more work.
